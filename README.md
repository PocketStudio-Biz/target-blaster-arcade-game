    // Modify sound generation code
}

// Option 2: Load external files
loadExternalSounds() {
    this.sounds.shoot = new Audio('assets/sounds/shoot.mp3');
}
```

### Game Balance
Adjust difficulty in `js/game.js`:
```javascript
this.difficultySettings = {
    easy: {
        targetSpeed: 0.5,     // Target movement speed
        spawnRate: 2000,      // ms between spawns
        timeLimit: 90,        // Game duration
        targetSize: 40,       // Target hit area
