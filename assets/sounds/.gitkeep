# Sounds Directory

This directory contains audio files for the game.

Note: The current implementation uses procedurally generated sounds via Web Audio API, so external sound files are optional.

If you want to add custom sounds, recommended formats:
- MP3 for broad compatibility
- OGG for better compression
- WAV for highest quality

Recommended files:
- shoot.mp3
- hit.mp3
- powerup.mp3
- gamestart.mp3
- gameover.mp3
- highscore.mp3
